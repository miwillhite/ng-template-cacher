# HTML → NG$templateCache

## Currently a learning project, we'll see if this actually goes somewhere…

I've been studying functional programming techniques (specifically related to JS) for a while now and want to put my education to the test!

## Setup

```bash
cd <root>
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
node index.js a/path/to/some/files/*.html
```

## Working on it…

* [x] Accept wildcard file names: `./fixtures/*.html`
* [ ] Accept wildcard directory names: `./fixtures/**/*.html`
* [ ] Validate argument input
* [ ] Allow options for naming module, app refs, output etc.
* [x] Wrap html templates in `$templateCache` syntax
* [ ] Wrap output in angular module
* [x] Print output to file
* [ ] Adding more items to this list
